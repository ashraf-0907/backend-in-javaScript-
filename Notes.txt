#HTTP Request to connect backend and frontend

Link -> OS -> browser -> Domain name Resolution -> IP address (having port no. and server address) -> connection establish

types of HTTP req:- 
1) GET (retain/fetch data)
2) PUT (update any data)
3) POST (submit any data)
4) DELETE (remove any data)

Idempotent req:- GET,PUT,DELETE as they work on predefined data or the data present at the database.
Not Idempotent :- POST as it create a new resource at the server.

# Express js
1) Framework of NodeJS works on server side application.
2) To install the express use "npm i express"
3) Creating a Server using these 2 lines
    a) import express from "express"
    b) const app = express(); // app is an instance of the express()
    c) app.listen(process.env.PORT||8000,()=>{ callback function }) app is listning on port mentioned in .env file 
       if .env port number is not available then 8000 will be alloted.
    d) Finally a live server is created.

Express Request:- 
1) The get request will be make by the client an in response it will send h1 to the route mention. 
app.get("route",(req,res)=>{
    callback function 
    eg:- res.send(<h1>Hello World</h1>);
})

2)
app.post("route",(req,res)=>{
    callback function
    // data will be present on the body of the html page. So to get the field data we will do
    const {a,b,c,.....} = req.body;
    console.log(a);
        .
        .
        .
})
